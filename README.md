# PWF Box Test

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Brief App Description
    The Static Data app below shows two boxes and uses react-xarrows to draw an Arrow between box1 and box2.

## Tasks: 
    
Modify the app so that when a user clicks on the dark canvas
1) A new box gets added to the screen in the position that the user clicked
1) A linking arrow gets drawn from the previous box to the new box


## Important Tips:
- You are allowed to use Google if needed
- Try to explain what you are doing as you work
- You don't need to write perfect code 
  - you can always refactor later, or explain what you would do given more time


## Out of Scope
- Styling
- Tests
